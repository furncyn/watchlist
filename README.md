# Watchlist

## Overview
A simple web app that tracks price changes of items in your watchlist.  Simply input the URL of an item and a notification will be sent to you when your item's price has dropped!
This project is still in an early stage so you would have to run it locally. Clone this repo and run `npm start`. Access the web page on `localhost:3000`
